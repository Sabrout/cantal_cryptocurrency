# Auto Evaluation

### Results:
In general, all the proposed functions work successfully. In addition, the project was developed with more attention
to the details of blockchain than anticipated. On the other hand, there is only one issue that is not solved yet. This issue is
a security problem when broadcasting the cheese stack and adding blocks to it in general.


### Expected Results Comparison:
After finalizing the project, we come to realize that all the initial objectives have been met and completed except 
for the communication between our implementation and the one of our meta group.


### Implementation Time:
As usual, it is hard to accurately estimate how much time was spent implementing, testing and debugging the software
but here is an approximation:

Paul : 70 hours

Guillaume : 49 hours

Omar : 42 hours

Mustafa : 25 hours

### Good Development Policy:
Following the provided policies to have a good development operation of the software, we succeeded in applying 
all of the guidelines without problem except for the pair programming rule and implementing stress tests because of
the short time frame of the project.
