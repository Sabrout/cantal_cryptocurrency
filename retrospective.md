# Retrospective

## Difficulties:
#### The reader-writer problem: 
We had difficulties dealing with reading and writing files at the same time by different threads which causes 
inconsistencies in our data.

#### Multi-threading:
Handling multiple threads to establish connections and synchronize them to function properly.

#### Data Generation:
Provide functions to generate big amounts of data for testing transactions, cheese stacks and wallets.

## Lessons:
The gained knowledge of Blockchain, Bitcoins, Peer-to-Peer protocol, Multi-threading and French language for Omar :P

## To take care next time:
To take care of proper documentations earlier such as Retrospective.

## Things that should have been different:
Use issues over GitHub.
